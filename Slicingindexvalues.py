#Slicing index values
#Slicing lets you select consecutive elements of an object using first:last syntax. DataFrames can be sliced by index values or by row/column number; we'll start with the first case. This involves slicing inside the .loc[] method.

#Compared to slicing lists, there are a few things to remember.

##You can only slice an index if the index is sorted (using .sort_index()).
#To slice at the outer level, first and last can be strings.
#To slice at inner levels, first and last should be tuples.
#If you pass a single slice to .loc[], it will slice the rows.
#pandas is loaded as pd. temperatures_ind has country and city in the index, and is available.



#Sort the index of temperatures_ind.
#Use slicing with .loc[] to get these subsets:
#from Pakistan to Philippines.
#from Lahore to Manila. (This will return nonsense.)
#from Pakistan, Lahore to Philippines, Manila.

# Sort the index of temperatures_ind
temperatures_srt = temperatures_ind.sort_index()

# Subset rows from Pakistan to Philippines
print(temperatures_srt.loc["Pakistan" : "Philippines"])

# Try to subset rows from Lahore to Manila
print(temperatures_srt.loc["Lahore" : "Manila"])

# Subset rows from Pakistan, Lahore to Philippines, Manila
print(temperatures_srt.loc[('Pakistan', 'Lahore'):('Philippines', 'Manila')])
